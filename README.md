# CoRT (Chain of Recursive Thoughts) 🧠🔄

## TL;DR: I made my AI think harder by making it argue with itself repeatedly. It works stupidly well.

### What is this?
CoRT makes AI models recursively think about their responses, generate alternatives, and pick the best one. It's like giving the AI the ability to doubt itself and try again... and again... and again.

### Does it actually work?
YES. I tested it with Mistral 3.1 24B and it went from "meh" to "holy crap", especially for such a small model, at programming tasks.


## How it works
1. AI generates initial response
2. AI decides how many "thinking rounds" it needs
3. For each round:
   - Generates 3 alternative responses
   - Evaluates all responses
   - Picks the best one
4. Final response is the survivor of this AI battle royale


## How to use the Web UI(still early dev)
1. Open start_recthink.bat
2. wait for a bit as it installs dependencies
3. profit??

If running on linux:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd frontend && npm install
cd ..
python ./recthink_web.py
```

(open a new shell)

```
cd frontend
npm start
```


## Examples


Mistral 3.1 24B + CoRT

Mistral 3.1 24B non CoRT

## Try it yourself
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
# export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here" # 기존 코드
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="AIzaSyDVh8FKTFmKN4bXl3eDW08J8r59rFIzsuA" # Gemini API
python recursive-thinking-ai.py
```

### The Secret Sauce
The magic is in:

 - Self-evaluation
 - Competitive alternative generation
 - Iterative refinement
 - Dynamic thinking depth
